Medium Problem - 2

Tina is a mathematics teacher. She gave multiple baskets of apples, with different prices on each basket to her students. She asked them to combine baskets 
and set a new price for the combined baskets by following the below process.

• In the given baskets, if the GCD of the prices of any two
adjacent baskets is greater than 1, then combine the two baskets of apples into one basket. . When two baskets are being combined, the price of the
combined basket should be the LCM (Least Common Multiplel of
those two baskets prices. . Students must continue this process as long as the GCD of the
prices of any two adjacent baskets is greater than one,

Write a program to solve the above problem and print the final basket prices.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer T , representing the number of test cases. The next T* 2 lines of input contain an integer N 
representing the number of baskets and the N number of spaceseparated integers representing the prices of each basket.

Output
The output should be T lines containing space-separated Integers representing final basket prices.

Explanation
For example, if the given test cases are 2,
Test case 1:
N = 6
prices = 12 4 2 3 6 7

•12,4 are two adjacent basket prices whose GCD is greater than 1, so combine the two baskets of apples into one basket and use their respective LCM 
as their basket price i,e 12 As a result, there will be 5 new baskets, and their prices will be 12 2 3 6 7
•12, 2 are two adjacent basket prices whose GCD is greater than 1, so combine the two baskets of apples into one basket and use their respective LCM 
as their basket price i,e 12 As a result, there will be 4 new baskets, and their prices will be 12 3 6 7
•12,3 are two adjacent basket prices whose GCD is greater than 1 so combine the two baskets of apples into one basket and use their respective LCM 
as their basket price i,e 12 As a result, there will be 3 new baskets, and their prices will be 12 6 7
.12,6 are two adjacent basket prices whose GCD is greater than 1 so combine the two baskets of apples into one basket and use their respective LCM 
as their basket price i,e 12 As a result, there will be 2 new baskets, and their prices will be 12 7

So output is 12 7

Test case 2: N = 7. prices = 2 2 1 1 3 3 3

•2,2 are two adjacent basket prices whose GCD is greater than 1. so combine the two baskets of apples into one basket and use their respective LCM 
as their basket price ie 2. As a result, there will be 6 new baskets, and their prices will be 2 1 1 3 3 3.
•3,3 are two adjacent basket prices whose GCD is greater than 1. so combine the two baskets of apples into one basket and use their respective LCM 
as their basket price ie 3 As a result, there will be 5 new baskets, and their prices will be 2 1 1 3 3
•3,3 are two adjacent basket prices whose GCD is greater than 1. so combine the two baskets of apples into one basket and use their respective LCM 
as their basket pricele 3 As a result, there will be 4 new baskets, and their prices will be 2 1 1 3
• There are no two adjacent basket prices whose GCD is Greater than one

So the output is 2 1 1 3
