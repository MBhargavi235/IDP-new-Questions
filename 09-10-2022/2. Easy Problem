Easy Problem
Ram went to the store to buy chocolates. In addition to the chocolate he likes, the chocolate box also contains other chocolates he doesn't like. 
He told the shopkeeper he would purchase the chocolate box if it contained more than half of the chocolates he liked. Each chocolate price is one rupee.
To make Ram purchase a chocolate box, the shopkeeper must remove the minimum number of chocolates that Ram dislikes.

Write a program to print the final cost of the chocolate box.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer T representing the number of test cases. The next T lines of input contain the string B and character
by space separated.
Where,
The string B represents the chocolate box (each character represents a chocolate).
• The character
represents the chocolate that Ram likes.

For example, if the given test cases are 2,

Test case 1: 
B = acaa
L-a

• The chocolate box contained more than half of the chocolates
Ram liked.
. The number of chocolates in the box is 4, each costs one rupee.
. So the output is 4.

Test case 2:

B = bobca

The chocolate box does not contained more than half of the chocolates Ram liked. To make Ram purchase a chocolate box, shopkeeper needs to remove 2b S. Then the chocolate box
will have 2 c s and 1 a chocolates, . The number of chocolates in the box is 3, each costs one rupee.
. So the output is 3.

Input1:
2
acaa a 
bcbca c
Ouput:
4
3

Input2:
2 
xaxxxxa a
aaabaa b
Ouput:
3
1

Solution:

t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    a,b=input().split()
    c=a.count(b)
    d=len(a)
    e=d-c
    if e<c:
        print(d)
    else:
        print(2*c-1)
