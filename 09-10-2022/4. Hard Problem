Hard Problem

There is a wall in Williams house. In order to make the wall look more! appealing, William asked James to paint the blocks red and blue. Y
ou may assume that below is a picture of the wall after James painting has been completed.

1   1   0   1   1
1   1   0   0   1
1   0   1   0   1
1   1   0   1   1
1   0   0   0   1

In the above picture, the red color blocks are represented with 1 and the blue color blocks are represented with O.
A connected area is a group of the same color blocks which are can be four way connected either horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).
For example, the below image contains four red colored connected

Sample Input1:
2
1 0
0 1
Output:
3
Sample Input2:
5
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
Output:
17

Solution:

def largestIlandOfGrid(grid):
    N=len(grid)
    
    def neighbours(r,c):
        for nr,nc in ((r-1,c),(r+1,c),(r,c-1),(r,c+1)):
            if 0<=nr<N and 0<=nc<N:
                yield nr,nc 
                
    def dfs(r,c,index):
        ans=1 
        grid[r][c]=index
        for nr,nc in neighbours(r,c):
            if grid[nr][nc]==1:
                ans+=dfs(nr,nc,index)
        return ans
    
    area={}
    index=2
    for r in range(N):
        for c in range(N):
            if grid[r][c]==1:
                area[index]=dfs(r,c,index)
                index+=1 
                
    ans=max(area.values() or [0])
    for r in range(N):
        for c in range(N):
            if grid[r][c]==0:
                seen={grid[nr][nc] for nr,nc in neighbours(r,c) if grid[nr][nc]>1}
                ans=max(ans,1+sum(area[i] for i in seen))
    return ans
                
n=int(input())
m=[]
for i in range(n):
    a=input().split()
    m.append([int(x) for x in a])
print(largestIlandOfGrid(m))
